# Interview : *** PROBLEM SOLVED ***

## Created Hello World Web Application using below tools
- Infrastructure as a code :  Terraform
- Cloud infrastructure : AWS
- Web App : Apache
- Its Hosted & Accessible in : http://50.112.182.11:80/

## Steps
- git clone https://github.com/shreeshailgumgeri/cnid-tech-tests.git
- python run.py (This script helps with further steps to run the application)

## Context

In the final stage of our interview process we want to discover how you handle infrastructure day-to-day. In preparation for the interview we request you complete the following task.

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Infrastructure Engineering team at Condé Nast. It is not a pass or fail, but it will be used as the basis for questions and discussion in the interview.   
We appreciate that your time is valuable, which is why we’ve designed this exercise to be completed in around 1 hour. If you cannot spare the time, you may want to consider option 2.

 
### Things we like

- An ability to handle code like a software engineer 
- Maintainability of solutions 
- Resilience, particularly to Chaotic Monkeys
- Ability to develop applications locally in a consistent environments
- Concise documentation
- Containers
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring, but you shouldn’t be concerned about it for now
- CI/CD, again, don’t worry about this for this exercise

## Option 1

Create a simple 'Hello World' web application (for example, node.js) and deploy it to a Cloud Infrastructure, such as an AWS account, using appropriate tools and best practices.  When deployed, the root url should display 'Hello World'. 

** Please note:  The application is not the important factor in this, it is the infrastructure we will want to discuss.**

## Option 2

If you have some personal code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be your own work.
- Ideally, it should involve an element of web development platform
- It should demonstrate how you approach any particular problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
- It should cover as many of the points that we are looking for in option 1

## Submission

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  Please include a README containing any relevant information.
